# redfly.ai
redfly.ai lets you synchronize your database with Redis transparently and generate a data access layer that integrates data access code with caching. This open-source repo is intended to make it easy for developers to understand and try out our system.

At this time, this repo aims to provide open-source source code that:

1. Let you easily verify that our system performs better than conventional techniques for data access at scale (This is v1 - this is ready to go & will be published soon).
2. Provide a way for anybody to test our Redis synchronization service from anywhere (TBD).
