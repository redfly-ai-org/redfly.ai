# redfly.ai
redfly.ai lets you synchronize your database with Redis transparently and generate a data access layer that integrates data access code with caching. This open-source repo is intended to make it easy for developers to understand and try out our system.

At this time, this repo aims to provide open-source source code that:

1. Let you easily verify that our system performs better than conventional techniques for data access at scale (This will be v1 - this is ready to go now).
2. Provide a way for anybody to test our Redis synchronization service (TBD).

Authentication is necessary to connect to our cloud services hosted on Azure. You can register with us here: https://transparent.azurewebsites.net/Identity/Account/Register

Note to check your junk folder for emails from redfly.ai - this is a new domain, so emails will go to the junk folder.
